[buttons]
### This section describes the configurable buttons within the
### notification center and NOT the buttons that appear in the
### notifications

# Note: If you want your buttons in the notification center to be
#       squares you should verify that the following equality holds:
#       [notification-center]::width
#          == [buttons]::buttonsPerRow * [buttons]::buttonHeight
#             + ([buttons]::buttonsPerRow + 1) * [buttons]::buttonMargin

# Numbers of buttons that can be drawn on a row of the notification
# center.
buttonsPerRow = 2

# Height of buttons in the notification center (in pixels).
buttonHeight = 60

# Horizontal and vertical margin between each button in the 
# notification center (in pixels).
buttonMargin = 2

# Labels written on the buttons in the notification center. Labels
# should be written between quotes and separated by a colon. For
# example:
# labels = "Wifi":"Bluetooth"

# Each label is represented as a clickable button in the notification
# center. The commands variable below define the commands that should
# be launched when the user clicks on the associated button.  There
# should be the same number of entries in `commands` and in `labels`
# commands = "sudo "wifiToggle":"bluetoothToggle"

[colors]
# Note about colors: Colors can be represented in (at least, I mean,
# who knows...) three different ways:
#   1. #RGB with "R", "G" and "B" hexadecimal numbers (0-9, A-F or
#      a-f).
#   2. #RRGGBB with each occurrence of "R", "G" and "B" are hexadecimal
#      numbers (0-9, A-F or a-f).
#   3. rgba(R, G, B, A) where "R", "G" and "B" are between 0 and 255
#      and A is a floating point number between 0 and 1 representing
#      the alpha channel (transparency).


# Background color for the notification center.
background = rgba(5, 5, 5, 0.4)

# Background color for the notification popups.
notiBackground = rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4)

# Color for the text (summary, body and application name) in
# notification popups.
notiColor = #ffffff

# Background color for "critical" notification popups.
critical = rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)

# Color for the text (summary, body and application name) in
# "critical" notification popups.
criticalColor = #F00

# Background color for "critical" notifications in notification
# center.
criticalInCenter = rgba(155, 0, 20, 0.5)

# Color for the text (summary, body and application name) in
# "critical" notification in notification center.
criticalInCenterColor = #F00


# Global text color
labelColor = #ffffff

### These button configurations are applied globally (except they
### get overwritten in the [buttons] section. The buttons section
### only applies to the configurable buttons within the notification
### center, while these configs also apply to the buttons within
### notifications.)
# Color for the text in the buttons.
buttonColor = #eae2e0

# Background color of button in hover state (mouse over)
buttonHover = rgba(10, 10, 10, 0.3)

# Text color of button in hover state (mouse over)
